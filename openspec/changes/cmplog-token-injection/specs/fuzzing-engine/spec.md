## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Get next mutated input

The system SHALL provide `fuzzer.getNextInput()` which returns a `Buffer` containing a
mutated input derived from the corpus. The system uses LibAFL's havoc mutations (bit
flips, byte flips, arithmetic, block insert/delete/copy, splicing) combined with token mutations (`TokenInsert`, `TokenReplace`) applied to a corpus
entry selected by the scheduler, followed by `I2SRandReplace` which may replace byte
patterns matching recorded comparison operands.

The token mutations operate on the `Tokens` metadata in the fuzzer state. `TokenInsert` selects a random token and inserts it at a random position in the input, growing the input buffer. `TokenReplace` selects a random token and overwrites bytes at a random position. If no `Tokens` metadata exists or the token list is empty, token mutations are skipped.

The method SHALL record the corpus ID of the selected entry as the "last corpus ID" for mutation depth tracking. When `reportResult()` subsequently adds a new corpus entry, it SHALL use this stored ID to determine the parent and compute depth.

#### Scenario: Mutations produce varied outputs

- **WHEN** `getNextInput()` is called 100 times with a single seed in the corpus
- **THEN** at least 2 distinct outputs are produced (mutations are not identity)

#### Scenario: Output respects maxInputLen

- **WHEN** a Fuzzer is configured with `maxInputLen: 128` and `getNextInput()` is called
- **THEN** the returned Buffer length SHALL NOT exceed 128 bytes

#### Scenario: I2S mutation uses comparison metadata

- **WHEN** `CmpValuesMetadata` contains `CmpValues::Bytes("foo", "bar")`
- **AND** the corpus contains an input with bytes `"foo"`
- **AND** `getNextInput()` is called multiple times
- **THEN** at least one returned input SHALL contain the bytes `"bar"` replacing `"foo"`
  (demonstrating I2S replacement)

#### Scenario: Token mutations can grow the input

- **WHEN** the fuzzer state contains `Tokens` metadata with token `"javascript"`
- **AND** the corpus contains a seed `"http://example.com"` (18 bytes)
- **AND** `getNextInput()` is called multiple times
- **THEN** at least one returned input SHALL have length greater than 18 bytes
  (demonstrating `TokenInsert` can grow the input)

#### Scenario: Token mutations use dictionary tokens

- **WHEN** the fuzzer state contains `Tokens` metadata with token `"javascript"`
- **AND** `getNextInput()` is called multiple times
- **THEN** at least one returned input SHALL contain the bytes `"javascript"`

#### Scenario: Selected corpus ID tracked for depth

- **WHEN** `getNextInput()` selects corpus entry with ID X
- **THEN** the Fuzzer's `last_corpus_id` SHALL be set to X
- **AND** a subsequent `reportResult()` that adds a new entry SHALL compute depth from entry X's metadata

### Requirement: Create fuzzer instance

The system SHALL provide a `Fuzzer` class constructable via
`new Fuzzer(coverageMap, config?)` that accepts a required coverage map `Buffer` and an
optional `FuzzerConfig` object. The Fuzzer SHALL stash a reference to the coverage map
buffer for zero-copy access on each iteration.

The config SHALL support the following fields, all optional with defaults:

- `maxInputLen` (number, default 4096): Maximum byte length of generated inputs.
- `seed` (bigint, optional): RNG seed for reproducible mutation sequences. If omitted,
  a random seed is used.

On construction, the Fuzzer SHALL enable the CmpLog accumulator so that `traceCmp` calls
record comparison operands. The Fuzzer SHALL also initialize `CmpValuesMetadata` on the
fuzzer state and include `I2SRandReplace` in its mutation pipeline.

On construction, the Fuzzer SHALL initialize `SchedulerMetadata` with `PowerSchedule::fast()` on the fuzzer state. The scheduler SHALL use `CorpusPowerTestcaseScore` as its `TestcaseScore` implementation (replacing the prior `UniformScore`).

On construction, the Fuzzer SHALL initialize the havoc mutator with `havoc_mutations()` merged with `tokens_mutations()`, providing both standard havoc mutations and dictionary-based token mutations in a single scheduled mutator.

#### Scenario: Create with defaults

- **WHEN** `new Fuzzer(createCoverageMap(65536))` is called with no config
- **THEN** a Fuzzer instance is created with maxInputLen=4096 and a random seed, holding
  a reference to the provided coverage map
- **AND** the CmpLog accumulator is enabled
- **AND** `SchedulerMetadata` with `PowerSchedule::fast()` is present on the state
- **AND** the havoc mutator includes token mutations

#### Scenario: Create with custom config

- **WHEN** `new Fuzzer(createCoverageMap(32768), { maxInputLen: 1024, seed: 42n })` is called
- **THEN** a Fuzzer instance is created with the specified configuration
- **AND** the CmpLog accumulator is enabled

#### Scenario: Reproducible with same seed

- **WHEN** two Fuzzer instances are created with the same seed and coverage maps of the
  same size, and the same sequence of addSeed/getNextInput/reportResult calls is performed
- **THEN** both instances SHALL produce identical mutation sequences
